# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Likhitha Kempegowda

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I'm a **Data Scientist & Analyst** with a strong belief that good data, when combined with clear communication and thoughtful design, can drive real-world impact - whether it's informing public health decisions, uncovering trade risks, or helping organizations make smarter business moves.

I recently graduated with a **Masterâ€™s in Data Science from George Washington University** (GPA: 3.96), I bring 2+ years of experience across industries - from building BI dashboards in **finance** and **cybersecurity** to modeling risk in **public health** and **policy** domains.

ðŸ“Š I specialize in:  
- Telling compelling stories with data (think: maps, dashboards, and decision-ready visuals)  
- Building predictive models with R and Python  
- Cleaning, wrangling, and making sense of messy real-world data  
- Explaining complex models to non-technical stakeholders  

ðŸŽ¯ I care deeply about:
- **Equity-centered analytics** - surfacing insights that highlight disparities and drive change  
- **Clean, clear visual storytelling** - because how we present data matters as much as the data itself  
- **Continuous learning** - currently exploring LLMs, real-time dashboards, and GenAI tools for analysts  

When Iâ€™m not coding or designing dashboards, youâ€™ll find me exploring hiking trails, experimenting with new cuisines, or solving jigsaw puzzles.
